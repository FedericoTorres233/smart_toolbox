## What is Smart Toolbox?

This project addresses human errors in work environments with tools, which can cause accidents and/or additional costs. With the help of various technologies, I created a system that allows greater control over the tools in a workshop, thus reducing the risk of an accident.

Smart Toolbox is a system made up of 4 parts:
- A mobile application: it is an android application that allows the user to:
     * Register with first and last name
     * Scan the QR code of a toolbox
     * See the tasks to be carried out
     * Check the missing tools linked to a box.

- A graphical user interface (GUI): it is a desktop application that allows the manager to see detailed information of each box, upload tasks for each user and decide when the toolboxes have to be stored, so that the Smart Toolbox system is activated.

- Toolbox microcontroller: Sends its status and its missing tools to an online database. It has a QR code on the outside so that a user can link to it.

- An online database: It is the connection between all the other parts of Smart Toolbox.
